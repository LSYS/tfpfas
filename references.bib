The number of industrial sites that manufacture or use these compounds, the number of military fire training areas, and the number of wastewater treatment plants are all significant predictors of PFAS detection frequencies and concentrations in public water supplies. Among samples with detectable PFAS levels, each additional military site within a watershed\textquoteright{}s eight-digit hydrologic unit is associated with a 20% increase in PFHxS, a 10% increase in both PFHpA and PFOA, and a 35% increase in PFOS. The number of civilian airports with personnel trained in the use of aqueous film-forming foams is significantly associated with the detection of PFASs above the minimal reporting level. We find drinking water supplies for 6 million U.S. residents exceed US EPA\textquoteright{}s lifetime health advisory (70 ng/L) for PFOS and PFOA. Lower analytical reporting limits and additional sampling of smaller utilities serving \textless{}10000 individuals and private wells would greatly assist in further identifying PFAS contamination sources.},

High concentration of PFHxA occurred in the medium season, and showed a linear decreasing trend from upstream to downstream. The majority of other PFASs did not show clear seasonal variation. Composition profiles indicated that the JRE was mainly contaminated by short-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), shipbuilding industry, multiple wastewater and river runoff were identified as major potential sources.},

Spatial trends for perfluoroalkyl acids and many precursors enabled a better understanding of PFAS composition, transport, and transformation. All PFASs without analytical standards were semi-quantified. Summed PFAS and individual PFAS concentrations were often higher at depth than near the surface in soil and groundwater. Zwitterionic and cationic compounds composed a majority of the total PFAS mass (up to 97%) in firefighter training area (FTA) soil. Composition of PFAS class, chain length, and structural isomers changed with depth and distance from the FTA, suggesting in situ transformation and differential transport. The percentage of branched perfluorooctane sulfonate increased with depth, consistent with differential isomeric transport. However, linear perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was enriched, suggesting fluorotelomer precursor transformation to linear PFOA. Perfluorohexane sulfonamide, a potential transformation product of sulfonamide-based PFASs, was present at high concentrations (maximum 448 ng/g in soil, 3.4 mg/L in groundwater). Precursor compounds may create long-term sources of perfluoroalkyl acids, although many pathways remain unknown; precursor analysis is critical for PFAS fate and transport understanding.},

Average PFAS concentrations in surface sediments from each lake or reservoir varied from 0.086 ng/g dw to 5.79 ng/g dw with an average of 1.15 ng/g dw. Among five lake regions, average PFAS concentrations for the lakes from Eastern Plain Region were the highest. Perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluoroundecanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) were the predominant PFASs in surface sediments. The significant positive correlations between PFAS concentrations and total organic carbon, total nitrogen and total phosphorus contents in sediments revealed the influences of sedimentary characteristics on PFAS occurrence. A two-dimensional hierarchical cluster analysis heat map was depicted to analyze the possible origins of sediments and individual PFAS. The food-packaging, textile, electroplating, firefighting and semiconductor industry emission sources and the precious metals and coating industry emission sources were identified as the main sources by two receptor models, with contributions of 77.7 and 22.3% to the total concentrations of C4-C14- perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids and PFOS, respectively.},

They do not easily degrade, and some are known to pose serious ecological and human health concerns at trace concentrations (ng L\textminus{}1 levels). Per and polyfluoroalkyl substances persist in treated wastewater and are inadvertently introduced into the environment when treated wastewater is reused as an irrigation source. The Pennsylvania State University (PSU) has been sprayirrigating its wastewater at a 2.45 km2 mixeduse agricultural and forested site known as the ``Living Filter'' since the 1960s. To understand the spatiotemporal patterns of 20 PFAS at the Living Filter, water samples were collected bimonthly from fall 2019 through winter 2021 from the PSU's wastewater effluent and from each of the site's 13 monitoring wells. Crop tissue was collected at the time of harvest to assess PFAS presence in corn silage and tall fescue grown at the study site. Total measured PFAS concentrations in the monitoring wells ranged from nondectable to 155 ng L\textminus{}1, with concentrations increasing with the direction of groundwater flow. Concentrations within each well exhibited little temporal variability across sampling events, with mixed relationships between PFAS and groundwater elevation observed between wells. Further, \textgreater{}84% of the PFAS present in livestock feed crops were shortchain compounds, with PFAS consumed annually by livestock fed crops harvested from the site estimated to be 2.46--7.67 mg animal\textminus{}1 yr\textminus{}1. This research provides insight into the potential impacts of longterm beneficial reuse of treated wastewater on groundwater and crop tissue quality.},

In this study, 187 serum samples from teenagers (age = 14 years), 22 tap water samples and 40 soil samples were collected in areas within 0-11 km of a fluorochemical industrial plant in Huantai County, Shandong Province, and concentrations of 18 PFASs were quantified by UPLC-MS/MS. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was found to be predominant, concentrations of which ranged from 40.4 to 845 ng/mL in serum, from 2.88 to 19.3 ng/L in tap water, from 4.40 to 189 ng/g in soil, and accounting for 84.1-98.6%, 15.9-79.8%, and 73.8-96.7% of the total PFASs, respectively. Statistical analysis demonstrated that concentrations of perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) in soil (C5-C9) and serum (C8-C10) were associated with the industrial plant. And PFOA concentrations in tap water were not relevant to the industrial plant, which were comparable with the non-contaminated area and lower than the threshold value recommended by U.S. EPA (70 ng/mL), indicating that the contribution to the high concentration of serum PFOA of local teenagers by drinking water was limited. Moreover, PFCAs in soil only made a limited contribution to the serum PFCAs of local residents by direct inhalation and dermal exposure, but the potential health risk by the soil via food chain should be paid attention to. Furthermore, health risk assessment demonstrated that high concentrations of PFOA in serum could pose potential health risk to local teenagers. Therefore, effective measures should be taken to attenuate the health risks caused by the industrial plant to local residents, and further epidemiological studies should be carried out in the future.},

In Australia, limited spatial data are available on PFAS levels in WWTPs influent, while no temporal data have been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence and temporal trend of PFAS in the influent of two large WWTPs in Australia (WWTP A and B) over a four-year period. Daily influent samples were collected over one week at different seasons from 2014 to 2017. Eleven perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAA) (i.e. seven perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and four perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSA)) were detected with mean \Sigma{}11PFAA concentrations of 57 \textpm{} 3.3--94 \textpm{} 17 ng/L at WWTP A, and 31 \textpm{} 6.1--142 \textpm{} 73 ng/L at WWTP B. The highest mean concentrations were observed for perfluorohexanoate (PFHxA) (20 \textpm{} 2 ng/L) in WWTP A, and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) (17 \textpm{} 13 ng/L) in WWTP B. The precursor 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate was detected over five sampling periods from Aug 2016 to Oct 2017, with mean concentrations of 37 \textpm{} 18--138 \textpm{} 51 ng/L for WWTP A and 8.8 \textpm{} 4.5--29 \textpm{} 5.1 ng/L for WWTP B. Higher concentration of 6:2 FTS (1.8--11 folds) than those of PFOA and PFOS in WWTP A indicate a likely substitution of C8 PFAA by fluorotelomer-based PFAS in this catchment. Temporal trends (annual and seasonal) in per-capita mass load were observed for some PFAA, increasing for PFPeA, PFHxA, PFHpA, PFNA, and PFHxS, while decreasing for PFBS and PFOS in either WWTPs. Notably, elevated levels of PFOS in October 2017 were observed at both WWTPs with the highest per capita mass load of up to 67 \mu{}g/day/inhabitant. For some PFAS release trends, longer sampling periods would be required to achieve acceptable statistical power.},

Understanding pollution sources is essential for environmental regulation but source attribution for PFASs has been confounded by limited information on industrial releases and rapid changes in chemical production. Here we use principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering, and geospatial analysis to understand source contributions to 14 PFASs measured across 37 sites in the Northeastern United States in 2014. PFASs are significantly elevated in urban areas compared to rural sites except for perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), N-methyl perfluorooctanesulfonamidoacetic acid (N-MeFOSAA), perfluoroundecanate (PFUnDA) and perfluorododecanate (PFDoDA). The highest PFAS concentrations across sites were for perfluorooctanate (PFOA, 56 ng L-1) and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFOS, 43 ng L-1) and PFOS levels are lower than earlier measurements of U.S. surface waters. PCA and cluster analysis indicates three main statistical groupings of PFASs. Geospatial analysis of watersheds reveals the first component/cluster originates from a mixture of contemporary point sources such as airports and textile mills. Atmospheric sources from the waste sector are consistent with the second component, and the metal smelting industry plausibly explains the third component. We find this source-attribution technique is effective for better understanding PFAS sources in urban areas.},

This study investigates the occurrence, distribution, partitioning behavior, and sources of 26 PFASs in water and sediments from the four lakes of TP. The \Sigma{}PFAS concentrations ranged from 338 to 9766 pg L-1 in water, and 12.2-414 pg g-1 dry weight in sediments. Perfluorobutanonic acid (PFBA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) were detected in all samples. Qinghai Lake had the highest \Sigma{}PFAS concentrations in both water and sediments, while the Ranwu Lake had the lowest. The functional groups and CF2 moiety units were investigated as essential factors influencing the partition behavior. Principal component analysis (PCA) combined back-trajectory was used to infer possible sources of PFASs. The results suggested that the main source of PFASs in Yamdrok Lake, Namco Lake, and Ranwu Lake on southern TP were mainly originated from South Asia via long-range atmospheric transport (LRAT); while for the Qinghai Lake of northern TP, LRAT, local emissions, and tourism activities were the primary sources of PFASs.},

The total concentrations of PFASs (\Sigma{}14PFASs) in groundwater samples ranged from 2.69 to 556 ng/L (mean 43.1 ng/L). The detection rates of shorter chain (C4-C9) PFASs were 62.75-100%, higher than those of long chain (\textgreater{} C10) PFASs with detection rates of less than 40%. The source identification using hierarchical cluster analysis and Spearman rank correlation analysis suggested that domestic sewage and atmospheric deposition may contribute significantly to the PFAS occurrence in groundwater in non-industrial areas, while the nearby industrial parks may contribute some, but not at a significant level. Furthermore, the human health risk assessment analysis shows that the health hazards associated with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and PFOS, two of the main PFAS constituents in groundwater from non-industrial areas, were one or two orders of magnitude higher than those in a previous study, but were unlikely to cause long-term harm to the residents via the drinking water exposure pathway alone.},

However, these trend data must be examined within the context of design changes in NHANES over 2003–2014 resulting in oversampling of Hispanics other than Mexican Americans starting 2007–2008 survey cycle and oversampling of non-Hispanic Asians starting 2011–2012 survey cycle. In order to examine how design changes may have affected computations of adjusted and unadjusted concentrations, the data were analyzed using the racial/ethnic categories prior to and after oversampling of Hispanics other than Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic Asians was put into place.}

    abstract = { After several decades of widespread use, some per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) were phased-out of use due to concerns raised by their persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic properties. Our objective was to evaluate temporal trends in serum PFAS levels among 1257 middle-aged and older California women (ages 40–94) during a four year period, beginning approximately 5–10 years after these phase-outs began. An online SPE-HPLC-MS/MS was used to measure 10 long-chain PFASs in serum from blood collected cross-sectionally during 2011–2015 from a subset of participants in the California Teachers Study. Results from multivariable linear regression analyses indicated that serum concentrations of nearly all PFASs declined on average 10\% to 20\% per year. Serum levels of perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) did not significantly decline. With the exception of PFHxS, the downward trend in serum concentrations was evident for all PFASs across all ages, although declines were comparatively steeper among the oldest women. These findings suggest that the phase-out of some common PFASs has resulted in reduced human exposures to them. The lack of a decline for PFHxS suggests that these exposures may be ongoing and underscores the importance of continued biomonitoring and research efforts to elucidate current pathways of exposure. }

	abstract = {Objectives
	Experimental models have demonstrated a link between exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and decreased fertility and fecundability; however, human studies are scarce. We assessed the associations between preconception plasma PFAS concentrations and fertility outcomes in women.
	Methods
	In a case-control study nested within the population-based Singapore Preconception Study of Long-Term Maternal and Child Outcomes (S-PRESTO), we measured PFAS in plasma collected in 2015–2017 from 382 women of reproductive age trying to conceive. Using Cox proportional hazards regression (fecundability ratios [FRs]) and logistic regression (odds ratios [ORs]) models, we assessed the associations of individual PFAS with time-to-pregnancy (TTP), and the likelihoods of clinical pregnancy and live birth, respectively, over one year of follow-up, adjusting for analytical batch, age, education, ethnicity, and parity. We used Bayesian weighted quantile sum (BWQS) regression to assess the associations of the PFAS mixture with fertility outcomes.
	Results
	We found a 5–10 % reduction in fecundability per quartile increase of exposure to individual PFAS (FRs [95 % CIs] for clinical pregnancy = 0.90 [0.82, 0.98] for PFDA; 0.88 [0.79, 0.99] for PFOS; 0.95 [0.86, 1.06] for PFOA; 0.92 [0.84, 1.00] for PFHpA). We observed similar decreased odds of clinical pregnancy (ORs [95 % CIs] = 0.74 [0.56, 0.98] for PFDA; 0.76 [0.53, 1.09] for PFOS; 0.83 [0.59, 1.17] for PFOA; 0.92 [0.70, 1.22] for PFHpA) and live birth per quartile increases of individual PFAS and the PFAS mixture (ORs [95 % CIs] = 0.61 [0.37, 1.02] for clinical pregnancy, and 0.66 [0.40, 1.07] for live birth). Within the PFAS mixture, PFDA followed by PFOS, PFOA, and PFHpA were the biggest contributors to these associations. We found no evidence of association for PFHxS, PFNA, and PFHpS and the fertility outcomes examined.
	Conclusions
	Higher PFAS exposures may be associated with decreased fertility in women. The potential impact of ubiquitous PFAS exposures on infertility mechanisms requires further investigation.}

Concentrations of 22 target PFASs and general water quality parameters were determined monthly for a year in filtered water samples from five tributaries and three sampling stations of an urban water body. Of the 22 target PFASs, 17 PFASs were detected with a frequency >93% including PFCAs: C4-C12 perfluoroalkyl carboxylates, C4, C6, C8, and C10 perfluoroalkane sulfonates, perfluorooctane sulfonamides and perfluorooctane sulfonamide substances (FOSAMs), C10 perfluoroalkyl phosphonic acid (C10 PFPA), 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid (6:2 FTSA) and C8/C8 perfluoroalkyl phosphinic acid (C8/C8-PFPIA). The most abundant PFASs in water were PFBS (1.4–55 ng/L), PFBA (1.0–23 ng/L), PFOS (1.5–24 ng/L) and PFOA (2.0–21 ng/L). In the tributaries, PFNA concentrations ranged from 1.2 to 87.1 ng/L except in the May 2013 samples of two tributaries, which reached 520 and 260 ng/L. Total PFAS concentrations in the sediment samples ranged from 1.6 to 15 ng/g d.w. with EtFOSAA, PFDoA, PFOS and PFDA being the dominant species. Based on water and sediment data, two types of sources were inferred: one-time or intermittent point sources and continuous non-point sources. FOSAMs and PFOS released continually from non-point sources, C8/C8 PFPIA, PFDoA and PFUnA was released from point sources. The highly water soluble short-chain PFASs including PFBA, PFPeA and PFBS remained predominantly in the water column. The factors governing solution phase concentrations appear to be compound hydrophobicity and sorption to suspended particles. Correlation of the dissolved phase concentrations with precipitation data suggested stormwater was a significant source of PFBA, PFBS, PFUnA and PFDoA. Negative correlations with precipitation indicated sources feeding FOSAA and FOSA directly into the tributaries.}

abstract = {Background
While socioeconomic position (SEP) is consistently related to pregnancy and birth outcome disparities, relevant biological mechanisms are manifold, thus necessitating more comprehensive characterization of SEP-exposome associations during pregnancy.
Objectives
We implemented an exposomic approach to systematically characterize the socioeconomic landscape of prenatal exposures in a setting where social segregation was less distinct in a hypotheses-generating manner.
Methods
We described the correlation structure of 134 prenatal exogenous and endogenous sources (e.g., micronutrients, hormones, immunomodulatory metabolites, environmental pollutants) collected in a diverse, population-representative, urban, high-income longitudinal mother-offspring cohort (N = 1341; 2009–2011). We examined the associations between maternal, paternal, household, and areal level SEP indicators and 134 exposures using multiple regressions adjusted for precision variables, as well as potential effect measure modification by ethnicity and nativity. Finally, we generated summary SEP indices using Multiple Correspondence Analysis to further explore possible curved relationships.
Results
Individual and household SEP were associated with anthropometric/adiposity measures, folate, omega-3 fatty acids, insulin-like growth factor-II, fasting glucose, and neopterin, an inflammatory marker. We observed paternal education was more strongly and consistently related to maternal exposures than maternal education. This was most apparent amongst couples discordant on education. Analyses revealed additional non-linear associations between areal composite SEP and particulate matter. Environmental contaminants (e.g., per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) and micronutrients (e.g., folate and copper) showed opposing associations by ethnicity and nativity, respectively.
Discussion
SEP-exposome relationships are complex, non-linear, and context specific. Our findings reinforce the potential role of paternal contributions and context-specific modifiers of associations, such as between ethnicity and maternal diet-related exposures. Despite weak presumed areal clustering of individual exposures in our context, our approach reinforces subtle non-linearities in areal-level exposures.}

abstract = {Background
Although some studies report that exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) during pregnancy and early life stages of a child could adversely impact neurodevelopment, literature shows mixed evidence.
Objectives
Using an ecological framework for human development, we assessed the association of risk factors for environmental PFAS exposure and childhood PFAS concentrations with behavioral difficulties among school-age children exposed to PFAS from birth, while also controlling for the important influence of the parenting and familial environment.
Methods
The study participants included 331 school-age children (6–13 years) born in a PFAS-contaminated area in the Veneto Region (Italy). We study the associations between environmental risk factors of maternal PFAS exposure (residential time, consumption of tap water, residence in Red zone A or B), and breastfeeding duration with parent assessments of children's behavioral problems (using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire [SDQ]), adjusting for socio-demographic, parenting and familial variables. The direct relationships between serum blood PFAS concentrations and SDQ scores was evaluated in a subset of children (n = 79), both with single PFAS and weighted quantile sum (WQS) regressions.
Results
Poisson regression models reported positive associations between high consumption of tap water and externalizing SDQ scores (Incidence Rate Ratio [IRR]: 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04–1.32) and total difficulty scores (IRR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.02–1.26). Childhood perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) were associated with higher internalizing SDQ scores (4th vs. 1st quartile, PFOS IRR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.06–2.25), externalizing scores (4th vs. 1st quartile, PFHxS IRR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.09–2.32), and total difficulty scores (4th vs. 1st quartile, PFOS IRR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.05–1.71; PFHxS IRR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.09–1.90). The WQS regressions confirmed the associations reported by single-PFAS analyses.
Conclusions
We observed cross-sectional associations of tap water consumption and childhood PFOS, and PFHxS concentrations with greater behavioral difficulties.}

We studied demographic, life-style and physiological determinants of serum PFAS concentrations in Swedish adolescents from a nation-wide survey, Riksmaten Adolescents 2016–17 (RMA, age 10–21 years, n = 1098). Serum samples were analyzed for 42 PFAS, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The cumulative probability model was used to estimate associations between serum PFAS and determinants, using ordinal logistic regression. Legacy linear (lin-) perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononaoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA), lin-perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and lin-/branched (br-) perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) were quantifiable in ≥70% of the samples. The emerging PFAS 9-chlorohexanedecafluoro-3-oxanone-1-sulfonic acid (9Cl-PF3ONS) was quantified in 5.4% of the samples, suggesting initiation of long-range transport far from production sites. Median concentrations of all legacy PFAS were <2 ng/g serum, with a few participants having very high (>100 ng/g serum) lin-PFHxS and lin-/br-PFOS concentrations due to previous high exposure from PFAS-contaminated drinking water. Legacy PFAS exposure was strongly associated with birth country of the participants and their mothers. 2-fold higher estimated adjusted mean (EAM) concentrations were seen among high income country participants with mothers from high income countries than among low/lower-middle income country participants with mothers from the same category. Menstruating females had lower br-PFOS EAM concentrations than those who were not. Iron status (plasma ferritin) among females may be a marker of intensity of menstrual bleeding, but it was not significantly associated with legacy PFAS concentrations among females. Further studies are needed to determine how physiological changes occurring around menstruation affect the toxicokinetics of PFAS in females. In conclusion, PFAS are pollutants of the industrialized world and some of the identified determinants may be overlooked confounders/effect modifiers that should be included in future PFAS/health studies among adolescents.}

Beside age, sex, fish consumption, parity and breastfeeding, the multiple regression models identified additionally consumption of offal and locally grown food, and use of cosmetics as possible exposures and menstruation as a possible route of elimination. Better knowledge on determinants of exposure is essential to lower PFASs exposure.}

Although neighborhood characteristics and the concept of built environment have been shown to affect individual health, measuring the effects of environmental risks on health has been a less developed area of disparities research. To examine spatial associations and the distribution of geographic patterns of sociodemographic characteristics, environmental cancer risk, and cancer rates, we utilized existing data from multiple sources. The findings from our initial analysis, which concerned with proximity to environmental hazards and at-risk communities, were consistent with results of previous studies, which often reported mixed relationships between health disparity indicators and environmental burden. However, further analysis with refined models showed that several key demographic and subdomains of cancer risk measures were shown to have spatial components. With the application of exploratory spatial data analysis, we were able to identify areas with both high rates of poverty and racial minorities to further examine for possible associations to environmental cancer risk. Global spatial autocorrelation found spatial clustering with percent black, percent poverty, point and non-point cancer risks requiring further spatial analysis to determine relationship of significance based on geography. This methodology was based upon particular assumptions associated with data and applications, which needed to be met. We conclude that careful assessment of the data and applications were required to properly interpret the findings in understanding the relationship between vulnerable populations and environmental burden. }

  abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are notoriously persistent pollutants that are found ubiquitously present in aquatic environments. They pose a big threat to aquatic life and human health given the bioaccumulation feature and significant adverse health effects associated. In our previous study, PFAS were found in surface waters from Biscayne Bay and tap waters from the East coast of South Florida, at levels that arouse human health and ecological concerns. Considering that Florida supports millions population as well as treasured, sensitive coastal and wetland ecosystems, we have expanded the PFAS monitoring study on the occurrence, composition, spatial distribution, and potential sources encompassing tap waters from counties on the West coast of South Florida and Central Florida, and surface waters from Tampa Bay, Everglades National Park adjacent canals, Key West, including Biscayne Bay area. A total of 30 PFAS were analyzed based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). PFAS were detected in all tap water (N = 10) and surface water samples (N = 38) with total concentrations up to 169 ng L−1. Higher PFAS concentrations (> 60 ng L−1) are mostly observed from polluted rivers or coastal estuaries in Biscayne Bay, and sites nearby potential points sources (military airbases, wastewater facilities, airports, etc.). Our findings on current PFAS contamination levels from diverse aquatic environments provide additional information for the development of more stringent screening levels that are protective of human health and the environmental resources of Florida, which is ultimately anticipated as scientific understanding of PFAS is rapidly growing.},

abstract = {Background
Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are public health concerns because of widespread exposure through contaminated foods/drinking water. Although some determinants of PFAS exposure have been suggested, the role of geographic location and race/ethnicity in PFAS exposure has not been well characterized.
Objectives
We examined potential determinants of PFAS from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN).
Methods
This study includes 1302 women aged 45–56 years from 5 SWAN sites where white women and women from one minority group were recruited (black from Southeast Michigan, Pittsburgh, Boston; Chinese from Oakland; Japanese from Los Angeles). We determined concentrations of 11 PFAS in serum samples collected in 1999–2000 and examined 7 PFAS detected in most women (>97%). Linear regression with backward elimination was used to identify important determinants of PFAS serum concentrations among a set of pre-specified variables (age, body mass index, site, race/ethnicity, education, financial hardship, occupation, born outside the United States (US), parity, menstrual bleeding within the past year, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and consumption of fish, dairy, pizza, salty snack, and French fries).
Results
Site and race/ethnicity were two major determinants of PFAS. White women had higher concentrations of linear perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) compared with the Chinese in Oakland (p < 0.0001) and blacks in Pittsburgh (p = 0.048). Black women in Southeast Michigan and Boston (vs. white women) had higher concentrations of linear (p < 0.001 for Southeast Michigan; p < 0.0001 for Boston) and total perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) (p < 0.001 for both Southeast Michigan and Boston) and 2-(N-methyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid (p = 0.02 for Southeast Michigan; p < 0.001 for Boston). Chinese (Oakland) and Japanese (Los Angeles) women had higher concentrations of perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) compared with white women in each site (p < 0.01 for both). Within white women, those in Pittsburgh had relatively higher concentrations of PFAS. Within Chinese and Japanese women, those who were born outside the US had significantly lower concentrations of most PFAS but significantly higher PFNA concentrations. Menstrual bleeding and parity were significantly associated with lower PFAS concentrations. Higher intake of salty snacks including popcorn was significantly associated with higher concentrations of linear PFOA, PFOS and 2-(N-ethyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid.
Discussion
Geographic locations and race/ethnicity play an important role in differential exposure to PFAS, with racial/ethnic burdens differing between PFOS, PFOA and PFNA. Menstruation and parity were also determinants of PFAS concentrations possibly as an elimination route.}

This study investigated PFAS levels and sources in ambient PM1 from 94 primary and secondary schools across six cities in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) during October to December 2018. We analyzed 32 PFAS compounds in PM1, with total PFAS levels at 58.92 pg/m3, ranging from 7.33 to 341.77 pg/m3. Perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs) dominated (median: 38.85 pg/m3), followed by perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs, median: 11.92 pg/m3), alternatives (median: 1.24 pg/m3), and perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) precursors (median: 0.29 pg/m3). The main source for PFAS was organic synthesis industries (47.91 %). Air masses originated from southern China, the east coast, and the South China Sea. PFAS showed positive correlations with cations and anions. Health risk assessment using estimated daily intake (EDI) and hazard quotient (HQ) found very low inhalation risk (HQ < 1). Our results highlight pollution from local industrial production and the eastern coastal areas as being the primary contributor to airborne PFAS in PRD schools. Elevated PFAS levels in PM1 present potential health risks, and their interactions with other pollutants in PM1 reflect their complex origins and behaviors.}

The results showed higher PFAS concentrations in the gas phase (197.7 ± 47.9 pg·m−3) compared to the particulate samples (48.3 ± 47.9 pg·m−3), indicating higher inhalation risks to human health. Short-chain alternative PFAS, such as perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), had higher concentrations in the gas-phase than the US EPA-regulated PFAS (e.g., PFHpA reached 142.6 ± 28.0 pg·m−3). Additionally, PFHpA had the lowest rain-air partition coefficient, suggesting its preferential distribution in the gas phase. In contrast, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) exhibited the highest levels of both the total deposition rate (12.4 ± 29.0 μg·m−2 yr−1) and wet deposition rate (40.2 ± 76.0 μg·m−2 yr−1) among the 24 PFAS analyzed in this study. Most PFAS had higher wet deposition fluxes than total deposition fluxes, indicating they may predominately accumulate at the water-air interfaces and could re-enter the atmosphere. Legacy perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) still had the highest concentrations (12.3 ± 8.5 pg·m−3) in particulate samples, ranking second in both gas-phase and total deposition samples and third in wet deposition samples. The results reveal that airborne PFAS in urban environments could pose negative impacts on human health and the natural environment.}

The profiles were dominated by 6:2 fluorotelomer alcohol, perfluorobutanesulfonic acid, and perfluorobutanoic acid, with median levels of 245, 117, and 78.0 pg m–3, respectively. Pre-PFAS and perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) exhibited relatively higher concentrations in the warm seasons, whereas perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs) were more abundant in the cold seasons. Particle-bound fractions of PFCAs with carbon number (Cn) ≤ 13 and PFSAs with Cn ≤ 8 were found at lower levels than in previous reports. Additionally, an odd–even pattern in the gas-particle distribution ratio was observed for PFCAs, with relatively higher values for odd-numbered compounds than for their even-numbered counterparts. Using positive matrix factorization analysis, aqueous film-forming foam-related activities, waste stream emissions, and fluoropolymer manufacturing were proposed as potential major sources in the studied areas, with their relative contribution quantified. These findings enhance our understanding of the atmospheric behavior of PFAS and facilitate the development of tailored PFAS mitigation strategies.}

Retrospective trend analyses of 58 PFAS were carried out in about 60 archived samples of the German Environmental Specimen Bank (ESB) and complemented by the total oxidizable precursor (TOP) assay to quantify the formation potential from precursors of perfluorinated alkyl acids (PFAAs) over time. In all samples, concentrations of C8 PFAS decreased, above all perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS; by 4 µg kg−1 per year) and its precursors. However, PFOS concentrations remained high in herring gull eggs (30 µg kg−1) and bream livers (100 µg kg−1) despite early restrictions. Concentrations of C10–C13 perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) increased in herring gull eggs until 2014 (∑=9.0 µg kg−1) and C14 PFCA continued to rise until 2020 (0.65 µg kg−1). In zebra mussels, the upwards trends of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and precursors of the short-chain C4–C7 PFCAs were even more pronounced – among them the 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonamidopropyl betaine (6:2 FTSA-PrB). These results show that long-chain PFAS continue to accumulate in wildlife despite being restricted and that their substitutes, the (ultra)short-chain PFAS increase in concentration.}

abstract = {Background
The influence of prenatal exposure to per- and poly- fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) on birth size and offspring adiposity is unclear, especially for the newer, shorter-chained replacement PFAS.
Methods
In the GUSTO multi-ethnic Singaporean mother-offspring cohort, 12 PFAS were measured in 783 cord plasma samples using ultra-performance-liquid chromatography-tandem-mass-spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS). Outcomes included offspring anthropometry, other indicators of body composition/metabolic health, and MRI-derived abdominal adiposity (subset) at birth and 6 years of age. PFAS were modeled individually, in categories of long-chain and short-chain PFAS, and as scores of three principal components (PC) derived using PC analysis (PC1, PC2, and PC3 reflect predominant exposure patterns to “very-long-PFAS”, “long-PFAS”, and “short-PFAS”, respectively). Associations with outcomes were assessed using multivariable linear regressions, adjusted for important covariates such as maternal sociodemographic and lifestyle factors.
Results
Overall, cord PFAS levels showed either no or positive associations (mostly for long-chain PFAS) with birth weight, length and head circumference. In general, PFAS were associated with higher neonatal abdominal adiposity, driven by shorter-chain PFAS. Perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA) was associated with higher volumes of superficial subcutaneous adipose tissue (sSAT) (3.75 [1.13, 6.37] mL per SD increase in PFAS) and internal adipose tissue (IAT) (1.39 [0.41, 2.38] mL). Higher levels of perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), short-chain PFAS, and PC3 were associated with higher IAT volume (β range 1.22–1.41 mL/SD, all P < 0.02), especially in girls. Higher PC3 score was additionally associated with higher sSAT (3.12 [0.45, 5.80] mL) volume. At age 6 years, most observed associations did not persist. No consistent associations were observed between PFAS and whole-body adiposity measures.
Conclusions
Fetal exposure to emerging short-chain PFAS was associated with higher abdominal adiposity at birth but not at age 6 years. Further research is needed to replicate the findings and to determine if these effects may reappear beyond early childhood. Population exposure to newer PFAS and consequent health impact must be monitored.}

Little is known, however, with regard to the occurrence of PFASs in automotive lubricants. In this study, concentrations and profiles of 13 perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), encompassing nine perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs; C4–C12) and four perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs; C4–C10), were determined in 18 automotive lubricants purchased in the United States. The lubricant extracts were analyzed before and after oxidization, to measure PFAAs and their precursors, using the total oxidizable precursor (TOP) assay. Following oxidation, lubricant extracts yielded ∑PFAA concentrations up to two orders of magnitude higher (range: 196–8300 ng/g; mean: 1840 ng/g) than those measured prior to oxidation (5.96–344 ng/g; 71.6 ng/g), which suggested the presence of notable amounts of PFAA precursors. Long-chain PFCAs (C8–C12;​ ∼70% of total) were the major PFASs detected (prior to oxidation). The mean molar increase in the concentration (pM/g) upon oxidation of lubricant extracts varied among the nine PFCAs in the following decreasing order: C4 (1350) > C12 (670) > C11 (570) = C5 (570) > C10 (460) > C9 (300) > C7 (140) = C6 (140) > C8 (110).

Results revealed widespread PFAS contamination, with total concentrations ranging from 4.306–53.716 ng/L (dissolved phase), 0.30–22.259 ng/L (SPM), and 0.561–20.354 ng/g (sediment). Short-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs, C4–C6) dominated aqueous phases (58.5% of Σ29PFAS), while long-chain PFCAs (≥C7) prevailed in SPM (68.1%) and sediments (69.4 %), reflecting chain-length-dependent partitioning. Spatial analysis identified the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) as a PFAS hotspot, with levels 2.5–3.5 times higher than adjacent bays, probably linked to fluvial inputs from industrial and urban sources. Historical data for the PRE further revealed contrasting temporal trends: PFOS concentrations declined markedly from 33.91 ng/L in 2012 to 2.06 ng/L in 2020, consistent with global phase-out measures, whereas PFOA levels peaked in 2020 (27.73 ng/L) before decreasing to 1.88 ng/L in 2023, likely reflecting its initial use as a PFOS substitute and subsequent regulatory control. Sediment-water partitioning coefficients (log Kd) increased by 0.33–0.35 log units per CF2 moiety, highlighting hydrophobic interactions as the key driver. Ecological risk assessment indicated low-to-moderate risks (RQs: 0.003–0.155), with PFOS in sediments near airports and industrial zones of PRE posing localized concerns. As the first comprehensive and systematic study on PFAS in the Shenzhen coastal area, this work provides novel insights into the distribution, partitioning behavior, and ecological risks of these persistent environmental contaminants. The findings underscore the need for source-specific management strategies to mitigate PFAS impacts in coastal urban environments.}

  abstract     = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are increasingly detected in agricultural environments, yet national-scale data on PFAS contamination in paired food crops and soils remain scarce. This study presents the first nationwide investigation of legacy and emerging PFAS in paired soil and grain samples (n = 160) from 11 provinces representing China’s major rice, wheat, and maize producing regions. PFAS were ubiquitously found in soils (median: 4.96 ng/g; range: 2.28--33.5 ng/g) and grains (7.74 ng/g; 2.40--25.3 ng/g), with short-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids being the dominant class. The emerging-to-legacy PFAS ratio was 2.16 in soils and 4.26 in grains, and crop PFAS levels were 1.5 times higher than those in corresponding soils, indicating the greater propensity of emerging PFAS to be transported into crops. Paddy soils exhibited significantly higher PFAS concentrations than dryland soils (p < 0.05), likely due to irrigation-driven accumulation. Intensive anthropogenic activities were positively related to PFAS concentrations in soils (r = 0.54, p < 0.05). PMF analysis attributed PFAS sources primarily to food packaging, textile processing, and fluorochemical industries. Risk prioritization using the ToxPi framework highlighted PFPeA, PFOA, PFOS, and HFPO--DA as priority compounds.}

This study examines transport and accumulation of PFPeA and PFBS in tomato plants, showing that sulfonic acid functional groups strongly impede translocation to fruits and mitigate food-chain transfer and human exposure.}

abstract = {Background
Many environmental chemicals have been shown to cross the placental barrier, threatening the health of offspring. Additionally gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) may affect the transplacental transfer ratios (TTRs) of environmental chemicals, but the rate of transfer of a wide variety of environmental chemicals have not been widely studied.
Objective
We examined the TTRs of per- and poly- fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), phthalates, parabens, bisphenols, and benzophenones in pregnant women, and if GDM increases transplacental transfer of these chemicals.
Methods
We examined 576 mother-newborn pairs from the Growing up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) birth cohort enrolled 2009–2010. Fetal cord plasma to maternal plasma ratios from samples around delivery (TTRs) were estimated for 10 PFAS, 6 phthalates, bisphenol-S (BPS), 2 parabens, and 2 benzophenones. GDM was defined as elevated fasting plasma glucose or 2 h plasma glucose from an oral glucose tolerance test at mid-gestation. We estimated covariate-adjusted associations of GDM with TTRs using multivariable regressions.
Results
Median TTRs ranged from 0.13 for benzophenone to 2.2 for mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate. Overall, TTRs were highest for phthalates and short-chain PFAS and lowest for benzophenone and long-chain PFAS. GDM was significantly associated with higher TTRs for perfluorooctanoic, perfluorononanoic, and perfluoroheptanoic acids, BPS, monoethyl phthalate, and oxybenzone. Mothers with GDM had 15% (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 5%, 25%) and 123% (95% CI: 32%, 214%) higher TTRs for oxybenzone and BPS respectively as compared to mothers without GDM.
Conclusions
We found high TTRs for multiple short half-life chemicals and more recently introduced short-chain PFAS. Importantly, GDM was associated with increased transplacental efficiency of several classes of environmental chemicals, particularly chemicals with shorter half-lives.}
