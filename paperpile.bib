              inequality in exposure to known toxic elements of air pollution
              is unclear. Here, we find that populations living in racially
              segregated communities are exposed to a form of fine particulate
              matter with over three times higher mass proportions of known
              toxic and carcinogenic metals. While concentrations of total fine
              particulate matter are two times higher in racially segregated
              communities, concentrations of metals from anthropogenic sources
              are nearly ten times higher. Populations living in racially
              segregated communities have been disproportionately exposed to
              these environmental stressors throughout the past decade. We find
              evidence, however, that these disproportionate exposures may be
              abated though targeted regulatory action. For example, recent
              regulations on marine fuel oil not only reduced vanadium
              concentrations in coastal cities, but also sharply lessened
              differences in vanadium exposure by segregation.",

              including PFCAs: C6-C13 perfluoroalkyl carboxylates, C4, C6, C8
              and C10 perfluoroalkane sulfonates, 5 perfluorooctane sulfonamide

              EtFOSE), bis (perfluorooctyl) phosphinic acid (C8/C8 PFPIA), and
              5:3 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid (5:3 acid) between bulk water
              and suspended particles in water column, and pore water and
              benthic sediments from a tropical urban water body. The
              distribution of PFASs between sorbed and dissolved phase was
              largely dependent on the perfluoroalkyl chain length (NCF2).
              PFCAs with NCF2 > 11 and perfluorodecane sulfonate (PFDS, NCF2 =
              10) were found predominantly in the suspended particles and
              sediments. By contrast, short-chain PFASs (NCF2 $\leq$ 7) were
              detected predominantly in the dissolved phase. Sediment acts as a
              sink for long-chain PFASs while short-chain PFASs are more easily
              transported via the aqueous phase. Compared with benthic
              sediments, suspended particles, especially those in the top water
              layer, carried much higher concentrations of PFASs (by a factor
              of >100), indicating the stronger sorption capability of
              suspended particles. The wide variation in PFAS concentrations in
              suspended particles ($\sum$PFASs concentrations: Log KD
              --desorption > Log KD --sorption > Log KD-SED) suggest that the
              distribution of PFASs in the field, especially between suspended
              particles and bulk water could not be well represented by lab
              results and that using the water concentrations in the bottom

              water and groundwater resources. This study investigated the

              Singapore and the efficacy of PFASs removal during flow through a
              constructed wetland (CW) treatment system. The CW treatment
              system consists of equalization tank, aeration lagoons,
              sedimentation tank, reed beds and polishing ponds. Target
              compounds included 11 perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) (7
              perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and 4 perfluoroalkane
              sulfonates (PFSAs)) and 7 PFAA precursors. Although total PFASs
              concentrations in the leachate varied widely (1269 to 7661 ng/L)
              over the one-year sampling period, the PFASs composition remained
              relatively stable with PFCAs consistently being predominant (64.0
              $\pm$ 3.8\%). Perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) concentrations
              were highly correlated with total PFASs concentrations and could
              be an indicator for the release of PFASs from this landfill. The
              release of short-chain PFAAs strongly depended on precipitation
              whereas concentrations of the other PFASs appeared to be
              controlled by partitioning. Overall, the CW treatment system
              removed 61\% of total PFASs and 50--96\% of individual PFASs.
              PFAAs were removed most efficiently in the reed bed (42--49\%),
              likely due to the combination of sorption to soils and sediments
              and plant uptake, whereas most of the PFAA precursors (i.e. 5:3
              fluorotelomer carboxylate (5:3 acid), N-substituted
              perfluorooctane sulfonamides (N-MeFOSAA and N-EtFOSAA)) were

              developed to effectively and efficiently translate the available
              scientific evidence into timely prevention-oriented action.
              OBJECTIVES: We applied the Navigation Guide systematic review
              method to answer the question ``Does fetal developmental exposure
              to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) or its salts affect fetal growth
              in animals ?'' and to rate the strength of the experimental
              animal evidence. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of
              the literature, applied prespecified criteria to the search
              results to identify relevant studies, extracted data from
              studies, obtained additional information from study authors,
              conducted meta-analyses, and rated the overall quality and
              strength of the evidence. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies met the
              inclusion criteria. From the meta-analysis of eight mouse gavage
              data sets, we estimated that exposure of pregnant mice to
              increasing concentrations of PFOA was associated with a change in

              day). The evidence, consisting of 15 mammalian and 6 nonmammalian
              studies, was rated as ``moderate'' and ``low'' quality,

              evidence for the question ``Does developmental exposure to
              perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) affect fetal growth in humans?''
              METHODS: We developed and applied prespecified criteria to
              systematically and transparently a) rate the quality of the
              scientific evidence as ``high,'' ``moderate,'' or ``low''; b)
              rate the strength of the human and nonhuman evidence separately
              as ``sufficient,'' ``limited,'' ``moderate,'' or ``evidence of

              and nonhuman evidence ratings into a strength of the evidence
              conclusion. RESULTS: We identified 18 epidemiology studies and 21
              animal toxicology studies relevant to our study question. We
              rated both the human and nonhuman mammalian evidence as
              ``moderate'' quality and ``sufficient'' strength. Integration of
              these evidence ratings produced a final strength of evidence
              rating in which review authors concluded that PFOA is ``known to
              be toxic'' to human reproduction and development based on
              sufficient evidence of decreased fetal growth in both human and
              nonhuman mammalian species. CONCLUSION: We concluded that
              developmental exposure to PFOA adversely affects human health

              human and nonhuman mammalian species. The results of this case

              pregnancy with childhood asthma, allergies and common infectious
              diseases in a prospective pregnancy cohort followed to age 7
              years. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Six PFASs (out of 19 measured) with
              at least 80\% of measurements above the limit of quantification
              (LOQ) in maternal plasma during pregnancy in two subcohorts of
              the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) were analyzed
              in relation to health outcomes: perfluorooctane sulfonic acid
              (PFOS), acid (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS),
              perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA),
              and perfluoroheptane sulfonic acid (PFHpS). Follow-up
              questionnaires were completed at 3 years by 1270 women and at 7
              years by 972 women among the 1943 with pregnancy questionnaire
              and PFAS measures. Health outcomes included parent reports of
              child's symptoms or doctor diagnosed asthma and allergic
              conditions at age 7 years and parent-reported frequency of
              various infections at 3 and 7 years of age. Logistic and Poisson
              regression were used. The false discovery rate was controlled at
              5\%. Sensitivity analyses on gender were performed. RESULTS:
              Among the allergy and asthma outcomes, a statistically
              significant inverse association was seen between PFUnDA
              concentrations and ever having atopic eczema in girls. PFUnDA
              also tended to be inversely associated with both wheeze and
              asthma. For infections from 0 to 3 and 6 to 7 years, 11
              significant positive associations were seen between PFASs and
              airways infections (bronchitis/pneumonia, throat infection,
              pseudocroup), ear infection and gastric flu/diarrhea; whereas 6
              inverse associations were seen for pseudocroup, ear infections
              and urinary tract infections. The majority of the findings with
              respect to infectious diseases were found in girls only.
              DISCUSSION: With the exception of an inverse association between
              PFUnDA and eczema, and a tendency of a similar association for
              wheeze and asthma, maternal PFAS levels during pregnancy showed
              little association with asthma or allergy related outcomes.
              Findings from the present study suggest immunosuppressive effects
              of PFASs on airways infections, such as bronchitis/pneumonia and
              throat infections, as well as diarrhea/gastric flu. Our results

              gender, exposure period and study design (cross-sectional and
              longitudinal) were also taken into consideration. MATERIAL AND
              METHODS: Included in the study was 378 participants with PFAS
              measurements at age 10 years and follow-up data at ages 10 years
              (cross sectional data) and 16 years (longitudinal data). Eight
              PFASs with at least 70\% of measurements above the limit of
              quantification (LOQ) in the child's serum were included in the
              present study: perfluoroheptanoate (PFHpA), perfluorooctanoate
              (PFOA), perfluourononanoate (PFNA), perfluorodecanoate (PFDA),
              perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnDA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS),
              perfluoroheptane sulfonate (PFHpS) and perfluorooctane sulfonate
              (PFOS). The PFAS levels were converted into interquartile range
              (IQR). In addition, perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA) detected
              in 60\% of the samples, was recoded into ``not detected
              /detected''. Binomial, multinomial and linear regression were
              used, followed by Bonferroni adjustment to correct for multiple
              comparisons. Sensitivity analyses evaluating the effect of
              extreme PFAS values and gender were performed. RESULTS: In the
              cross sectional data at 10 years a positive statistically
              significant association was seen between PFHpA and asthma in
              girls. In the longitudinal data, PFNA, PFDA and PFUnDA were
              inversely associated with atopic dermatitis (AD) in girls and
              with PFHxS in all participants and in boys. Further, PFNA and
              PFHpS were positively associated with rhinitis in girls and with
              PFOA in all participants. There seems to be a suggestive pattern
              of increased risk of allergic sensitisation in all participants
              and a decreased risk in boys, but due to different results in
              main and sensitivity analyses these findings should be
              interpreted with caution. No associations were found between
              PFASs and lung function. For airways infections and longitudinal
              data, PFDA was inversely associated with common cold, while
              positive association was found for PFHpA, PFOA, PFHpS and PFOS
              and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). DISCUSSION AND
              CONCLUSION: Our results lend further support for an
              immunosuppressive effect of PFASs on AD and LRTI. Gender seems to
              be important for some exposure-health associations. No clear
              pattern in exposure-health associations was observed with regard
              to exposure period or study design, with the exception of asthma
              where significant findings have mostly been reported in
              cross-sectional studies.",

               that are known or can be deduced from some well-studied PFAS.
               Currently, many different PFAS (on the order of several
               thousands) are used in a wide range of applications, and there
               is no comprehensive source of information on the many individual
               substances and their functions in different applications. Here
               we provide a broad overview of many use categories where PFAS
               have been employed and for which function; we also specify which
               PFAS have been used and discuss the magnitude of the uses.
               Despite being non-exhaustive, our study clearly demonstrates
               that PFAS are used in almost all industry branches and many
               consumer products. In total, more than 200 use categories and
               subcategories are identified for more than 1400 individual PFAS.
               In addition to well-known categories such as textile
               impregnation, fire-fighting foam, and electroplating, the
               identified use categories also include many categories not
               described in the scientific literature, including PFAS in
               ammunition, climbing ropes, guitar strings, artificial turf, and
               soil remediation. We further discuss several use categories that
               may be prioritised for finding PFAS-free alternatives. Besides
               the detailed description of use categories, the present study

              2005 through 2010 in a Mid-Ohio Valley community exposed to high
              levels of PFOA through drinking-water contamination. METHODS:
              Women provided serum for PFOA and PFOS measurement in 2005-2006
              and reported reproductive histories in subsequent follow-up
              interviews. Reported singleton live births among 1,330 women
              after 1 January 2005 were linked to birth records (n = 1,630) to
              identify the outcomes of preterm birth (< 37 weeks gestation),
              pregnancy-induced hypertension, low birth weight (< 2,500 g), and
              birth weight (grams) among full-term infants. RESULTS: We
              observed little or no evidence of association between maternal
              serum PFOA or PFOS and preterm birth (n = 158) or low birth
              weight (n = 88). Serum PFOA and PFOS were both positively
              associated with pregnancy-induced hypertension (n = 106), with
              adjusted odds ratios (ORs) per log unit increase in PFOA and PFOS
              of 1.27 (95\% CI: 1.05, 1.55) and 1.47 (95\% CI: 1.06, 2.04),
              respectively, but associations did not increase monotonically
              when categorized by quintiles. Results of subanalyses restricted
              to pregnancies conceived after blood collection were consistent
              with the main analyses. There was suggestion of a modest negative
              association between PFOS and birth weight in full-term infants
              (-29 g per log unit increase; 95\% CI: -66, 7), which became
              stronger when restricted to births conceived after the blood
              sample collection (-49 g per log unit increase; 95\% CI: -90,
              -8). CONCLUSION: Results provide some evidence of positive
              associations between measured serum perfluorinated compounds and

              PFOS and birth weight among full-term infants.",

              metabolic outcomes, and neurodevelopment. More than 4000 PFASs
              have been manufactured by humans and hundreds have been detected
              in environmental samples. Direct exposures due to use in products
              can be quickly phased out by shifts in chemical production but
              exposures driven by PFAS accumulation in the ocean and marine
              food chains and contamination of groundwater persist over long
              timescales. Serum concentrations of legacy PFASs in humans are
              declining globally but total exposures to newer PFASs and
              precursor compounds have not been well characterized. Human
              exposures to legacy PFASs from seafood and drinking water are
              stable or increasing in many regions, suggesting observed
              declines reflect phase-outs in legacy PFAS use in consumer
              products. Many regions globally are continuing to discover PFAS
              contaminated sites from aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) use,
              particularly next to airports and military bases. Exposures from
              food packaging and indoor environments are uncertain due to a
              rapidly changing chemical landscape where legacy PFASs have been
              replaced by diverse precursors and custom molecules that are
              difficult to detect. Multiple studies find significant
              associations between PFAS exposure and adverse immune outcomes in
              children. Dyslipidemia is the strongest metabolic outcome
              associated with PFAS exposure. Evidence for cancer is limited to
              manufacturing locations with extremely high exposures and
              insufficient data are available to characterize impacts of PFAS
              exposures on neurodevelopment. Preliminary evidence suggests
              significant health effects associated with exposures to emerging
              PFASs. Lessons learned from legacy PFASs indicate that limited
              data should not be used as a justification to delay risk
              mitigation actions for replacement PFASs.",

              (PFASs) are a large group of manufactured nonbiodegradable
              compounds. Despite increasing awareness as global pollutants, the
              impact of PFAS exposure on human health is not well understood,
              and there are growing concerns for adverse effects on kidney
              function. Therefore, we conducted a scoping review to summarize
              and identify gaps in the understanding between PFAS exposure and
              kidney health. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, \& MEASUREMENTS: We
              systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO Global Health,
              World Health Organization Global Index, and Web of Science for
              studies published from 1990 to 2018. We included studies on the
              epidemiology, pharmacokinetics, or toxicology of PFAS exposure
              and kidney-related health, including clinical, histologic,
              molecular, and metabolic outcomes related to kidney disease, or
              outcomes related to the pharmacokinetic role of the kidneys.
              RESULTS: We identified 74 studies, including 21 epidemiologic, 13
              pharmacokinetic, and 40 toxicological studies. Three
              population-based epidemiologic studies demonstrated associations
              between PFAS exposure and lower kidney function. Along with
              toxicology studies (n=10) showing tubular histologic and cellular
              changes from PFAS exposure, pharmacokinetic studies (n=5)
              demonstrated the kidneys were major routes of elimination, with
              active proximal tubule transport. In several studies (n=17), PFAS
              exposure altered several pathways linked to kidney disease,
              including oxidative stress pathways, peroxisome
              proliferators-activated receptor pathways, NF-E2-related factor 2
              pathways, partial epithelial mesenchymal transition, and enhanced
              endothelial permeability through actin filament modeling.
              CONCLUSIONS: A growing body of evidence portends PFASs are

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The number of studies addressing per- and
              polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and cancer is increasing. Many
              communities have had water contaminated by PFAS, and cancer is
              one of the important community concerns related to PFAS exposure.
              OBJECTIVES: We critically reviewed the evidence relating to PFAS
              and cancer from an epidemiologic standpoint to highlight
              directions for future research that would be the most likely to
              meaningfully increase knowledge. METHODS: We conducted a search
              in PubMed for studies of cancer and PFAS (through 9/20/2020). We
              identified epidemiologic studies that provided a quantitative
              estimate for some measure of the association between PFAS and
              cancer. Here, we review that literature, including several
              aspects of epidemiologic study design that impact the usefulness
              of study results. RESULTS: We identified 16 cohort (or
              case-cohort) studies, 10 case-control studies (4 nested within
              cohorts and 6 non-nested), 1 cross sectional study and 1 ecologic
              study. The cancer sites with the most evidence of an association
              with PFAS are testicular and kidney cancer. There are also some
              suggestions in a few studies of an association with prostate
              cancer, but the data are inconsistent. DISCUSSION: Each study's
              design has strengths and limitations. Weaknesses in study design
              and methods can, in some cases, lead to questionable
              associations, but in other cases can make it more difficult to
              detect true associations, if they are present. Overall, the
              evidence for an association between cancer and PFAS remains
              sparse. A variety of studies with different strengths and
              weaknesses can be helpful to clarify associations between PFAS
              and cancer. Long term follow-up of large-sized cohorts with large
              exposure contrasts are most likely to be informative.",

              perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA),
              perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), and perfluorononanoate (PFNA),
              we analyzed 7876 serum samples collected from a representative
              sample of the general U.S. population $\geq$12 years of age
              during NHANES 1999-2008. We detected PFOS, PFOA, PFNA, and PFHxS
              in more than 95\% of participants. Concentrations differed by sex
              regardless of age and we observed some differences by
              race/ethnicity. Since 1999-2000, PFOS concentrations showed a
              significant downward trend, because of discontinuing industrial
              production of PFOS, but PFNA concentrations showed a significant
              upward trend. PFOA concentrations during 1999-2000 were
              significantly higher than during any other time period examined,
              but PFOA concentrations have remained essentially unchanged

  abstract = "Background Human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances
              (PFAS) has been primarily attributed to contaminated food and
              drinking water. However, additional PFAS exposure pathways have
              been raised by a limited number of studies reporting correlations
              between commercial and industrial products and PFAS levels in
              human media and biomonitoring. Systematic review (SR)
              methodologies have been widely used to evaluate similar questions
              using an unbiased approach in the fields of clinical medicine,
              epidemiology, and toxicology, but the deployment in exposure
              science is ongoing. Here we present a systematic review protocol
              that adapts existing systematic review methodologies and study
              evaluation tools to exposure science studies in order to
              investigate evidence for important PFAS exposure pathways from
              indoor media including consumer products, household articles,
              cleaning products, personal care products, plus indoor air and
              dust. Objectives We will systematically review exposure science
              studies that present both PFAS concentrations from indoor
              exposure media and PFAS concentrations in blood serum or plasma.
              Exposure estimates will be synthesized from the evidence to
              answer the question, ``For the general population, what effect
              does exposure from PFAS chemicals via indoor media have on blood,
              serum or plasma concentrations of PFAS?'' We adapt existing
              systematic review methodologies and study evaluation tools from
              the U.S. EPA's Systematic Review Protocol for the PFBA, PFHxA,
              PFHxS, PFNA, and PFDA IRIS Assessments and the Navigation Guide
              for exposure science studies, as well as present innovative
              developments of exposure pathway-specific search strings for use
              in artificial intelligence screening software. Data Sources We
              will search electronic databases for potentially relevant
              literature, including Web of Science, PubMed, and ProQuest.
              Literature search results will be stored in EPA's Health and
              Environmental Research Online (HERO) database. Study eligibility
              and criteria Included studies will present exposure measures from
              indoor media including consumer products, household articles,
              cleaning products, personal care products, plus indoor air and
              dust, paired with PFAS concentrations in blood, serum or plasma
              from adults and/or children in the general population. We focus
              on a subset of PFAS chemicals including perfluorooctanoic acid
              (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), perfluorobutanoic acid
              (PFBA), perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), perfluorodecanoic acid

              synthesis methods Studies will be prefiltered at the title and
              abstract level using computationally intelligent search strings
              to expedite the screening process for reviewers. Two independent

              source of persistent perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) for
              children. OBJECTIVES: We studied occurrence and levels of PFCs in
              human milk in relation to maternal serum together with the
              temporal trend in milk levels between 1996 and 2004 in Sweden.
              Matched, individual human milk and serum samples from 12
              primiparous women in Sweden were analyzed together with composite
              milk samples (25-90 women/year) from 1996 to 2004. RESULTS: Eight
              PFCs were detected in the serum samples, and five of them were
              also above the detection limits in the milk samples.
              Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorohexanesulfonate
              (PFHxS) were detected in all milk samples at mean concentrations
              of 0.201 ng/mL and 0.085 ng/mL, respectively.
              Perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFOSA), perfluorooctanoic acid
              (PFOA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) were detected less
              frequently. DISCUSSION: The total PFC concentration in maternal
              serum was 32 ng/mL, and the corresponding milk concentration was
              0.34 ng/mL. The PFOS milk level was on average 1\% of the
              corresponding serum level. There was a strong association between
              increasing serum concentration and increasing milk concentration
              for PFOS (r(2) = 0.7) and PFHxS (r(2) = 0.8). PFOS and PFHxS
              levels in composite milk samples were relatively unchanged
              between 1996 and 2004, with a total variation of 20 and 32\%
              coefficient of variation, respectively. CONCLUSION: The

              and investigated potential mediating factors using structural
              equation modelling. PIR was associated with 18 chemicals in 3 or

              perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHS), and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA)
              has been reported in humans and wildlife. Pharmacokinetic
              differences have been observed in laboratory animals. OBJECTIVE:
              The purpose of this observational study was to estimate the
              elimination half-life of PFOS, PFHS, and PFOA from human serum.
              METHODS: Twenty-six (24 male, 2 female) retired fluorochemical
              production workers, with no additional occupational exposure, had
              periodic blood samples collected over 5 years, with serum stored
              in plastic vials at -80 degrees C. At the end of the study, we
              used HPLC-mass spectrometry to analyze the samples, with
              quantification based on the ion ratios for PFOS and PFHS and the
              internal standard (18)O(2)-PFOS. For PFOA, quantitation was based
              on the internal standard (13)C(2)-PFOA. RESULTS: THE ARITHMETIC
              MEAN INITIAL SERUM CONCENTRATIONS WERE AS FOLLOWS: PFOS, 799
              ng/mL (range, 145-3,490); PFHS, 290 ng/mL (range, 16-1,295); and
              PFOA, 691 ng/mL (range, 72-5,100). For each of the 26 subjects,
              the elimination appeared linear on a semi-log plot of
              concentration versus time; therefore, we used a first-order model
              for estimation. The arithmetic and geometric mean half-lives of
              serum elimination, respectively, were 5.4 years [95\% confidence
              interval (CI), 3.9-6.9] and 4.8 years (95\% CI, 4.0-5.8) for
              PFOS; 8.5 years (95\% CI, 6.4-10.6) and 7.3 years (95\% CI,
              5.8-9.2) for PFHS; and 3.8 years (95\% CI, 3.1-4.4) and 3.5 years
              (95\% CI, 3.0-4.1) for PFOA. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these data,
              humans appear to have a long half-life of serum elimination of
              PFOS, PFHS, and PFOA. Differences in species-specific
              pharmacokinetics may be due, in part, to a saturable renal

              elimination from mice, rats and monkeys. The apparent elimination
              half-life of PFHxA in highly exposed humans ranged between 14 and
              49 d with a geomean of 32 d. The half-lives of PFHxA in mice,

              chemical class widely used in industrial and commercial
              applications because of their unique physical and chemical
              properties. Between 2013 and 2016 PFAS were detected in public
              water systems and private wells in El Paso County, Colorado. The
              contamination was likely due to aqueous film forming foams used
              at a nearby Air Force base. OBJECTIVE: To cross-sectionally
              describe the serum concentrations of PFAS in a highly exposed
              community, estimate associations with drinking water source, and
              explore potential demographic and behavioral predictors. METHODS:
              In June 2018, serum PFAS concentrations were quantified and
              questionnaires administered in 213 non-smoking adult (ages 19-93)
              participants residing in three affected water districts. Twenty
              PFAS were quantified and those detected in >50\% of participants
              were analyzed: perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctane
              sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorononanoate
              (PFNA) and perfluoroheptane sulfonate (PFHpS). Unadjusted
              associations were estimated between serum PFAS concentrations and
              several predictors, including water consumption, demographics,
              personal behaviors and employment. A multiple linear regression
              model estimated adjusted associations with smoking history.
              RESULTS: Study participants' median PFHxS serum concentration
              (14.8 ng/mL) was approximately 12 times as high as the U.S.
              national average. Median serum concentrations for PFOS, PFOA,
              PFNA and PFHpS were 9.7 ng/mL, 3.0 ng/mL, 0.4 ng/mL and 0.2
              ng/mL, respectively. Determinants of PFHxS serum concentrations
              were water district of residence, frequency of bottled water
              consumption, age, race/ethnicity, and smoking history.
              Determinants of serum concentrations for the other four PFAS
              evaluated included: water district of residence, bottled water
              consumption, age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking history, and
              firefighter or military employment. CONCLUSIONS: Determinants of
              serum concentrations for multiple PFAS, including PFHxS, included
              water district of residence and frequency of bottled water
              consumption. Participants' dominant PFAS exposure route was
              likely consumption of PFAS-contaminated water, but certain
              demographic and behavioral characteristics also predicted serum
              concentrations.",

              investigated by studying Swedish rivers (n = 40) and recipient
              seawater (Baltic Sea and Kattegat; n = 18). Different composition
              profiles were observed in the rivers, with ten rivers having a
              remarkably high fraction of perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids
              (PFSAs; 65\% of the ƩPFASs) as compared to other rivers (19\%)
              suggesting major impact of one or several source types dominated
              by PFSAs. Population density and low latitude (south) were
              strongly correlated to the widely used perfluorooctanesulfonic
              acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) as well as to
              perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS). Significant relationships
              between several PFCAs and PFSAs (i.e. perfluorobutanoic acid

              alternatives of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), 6:2

              9-chlorohexadecafluoro-3-oxanonane-1-sulfonate (F-53B), were
              analyzed in groundwater samples (n = 102) collected from water
              wells in non-industrial areas. The total concentrations of PFASs
              ($\Sigma$14PFASs) in groundwater samples ranged from 2.69 to 556
              ng/L (mean 43.1 ng/L). The detection rates of shorter chain
              (C4-C9) PFASs were 62.75-100\%, higher than those of long chain
              (> C10) PFASs with detection rates of less than 40\%. The source
              identification using hierarchical cluster analysis and Spearman

               Understanding pollution sources is essential for environmental
               regulation, but source attribution for PFASs has been confounded
               by limited information about industrial releases and rapid
               changes in chemical production. Here we use principal component
               analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering, and geospatial analysis
               to understand source contributions to 14 PFASs measured across
               37 sites in the northeastern United States in 2014. PFASs are
               significantly elevated in urban areas compared to rural sites
               except for perfluorobutanesulfonate, N-methyl
               perfluorooctanesulfonamidoacetic acid, perfluoroundecanate, and
               perfluorododecanate. The highest PFAS concentrations across
               sites were those of perfluorooctanate (PFOA, 56 ng L−1) and
               perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS, 43 ng L−1), and
               perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) levels are lower than earlier
               measurements of U.S. surface waters. PCA and cluster analysis
               indicate three main statistical groupings of PFASs. Geospatial
               analysis of watersheds reveals the first component/cluster
               originates from a mixture of contemporary point sources such as
               airports and textile mills. Atmospheric sources from the waste
               sector are consistent with the second component, and the metal
               smelting industry plausibly explains the third component. We
               find this source-attribution technique is effective for better
               understanding PFAS sources in urban areas.",

               were found to be distinctly site-specific and influenced by the
               area's historic function, production structure of the plant,
               downpour-induced accidental pollution, and variations in the
               adsorption and transport of compounds. Very high concentrations
               of PFAS [mainly C4 and C8 perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs)]
               were found in topsoil and groundwater from both plants, with the
               highest values of 4.89 $\times$ 106 $\mu$g/kg dw and 1.10
               $\times$ 104 $\mu$g/L, respectively. Elevated concentrations of
               perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) in this study were
               attributed to their unintentional formation during the
               electrochemical fluorination process, which might be an
               overlooked source of PFCA. PFAS generally showed decreasing
               trends from shallow layers to the bottom of the soil core and
               demonstrated some downward migrations at different soil depths
               with time, and C4--C8 PFAS presented a deeper seepage than their
               long-chain homologues. Total organic carbon appeared to be more
               important for PFAS sorption to the topsoil than to the soil

              entered scientific and political discussions, is the group of the
              perfluorinated alkylated substances (PFAS). The most studied
              compounds from this group are perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and
              perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS), which are the most important

              study, eleven PFAS were investigated in effluents of municipal
              wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and in industrial wastewaters.
              PFOS and PFOA proved to be the dominant compounds in all sampled
              wastewaters. Concentrations of up to 340 ng/L of PFOS and up to
              220 ng/L of PFOA were observed. Besides these two compounds,
              perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) was also present in nearly all
              effluents and maximum concentrations of up to 280 ng/L were
              measured. Only N-ethylperfluorooctane sulphonamide (N-EtPFOSA)
              and its degradation/metabolisation product perfluorooctane
              sulphonamide (PFOSA) were either detected below the limit of

              Significantly, the highest emissions or PFOS were observed from
              metal industry whereas paper industry showed the highest PFOA
              emission. Several PFAS, especially perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA),
              perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA)
              and PFOS are predominantly emitted from industrial sources, with
              concentrations being a factor of 10 higher than those observed in
              the municipal WWTP effluents. Perfluorodecane sulphonate (PFDS),

              million in 2022 alone from the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and
              Jobs Act to support the replacement of lead water service lines.
              OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to determine the number and
              proportion of potential lead water service lines across New York
              City (NYC) and to evaluate the association between census
              tract-level racial/ethnic composition, housing vulnerability, and
              child lead exposure vulnerability with service line type
              (Potential Lead, Unknown) for n=2,083 NYC tracts. METHODS: We
              conducted a descriptive analysis assessing water service line
              material recorded in the NYC Department of Environmental
              Protection's Lead Service Line Location Coordinates database. We
              used conditional autoregressive Bayesian Poisson models to assess
              the relative risk [RR; median posterior estimates, and 95\%
              credible interval (CrI)] of service line type per 20\% higher
              proportion of residents in a given racial/ethnic group and per
              higher housing vulnerability and child lead exposure
              vulnerability index scores corresponding to the interquartile
              range. We also evaluated the associations in flexible natural
              cubic spline models. RESULTS: Out of 854,672 residential service
              line records, 136,891 (16.0\%) were Potential Lead, and 227,443
              (26.6\%) were Unknown. In fully adjusted models, higher
              proportions of Hispanic/Latino residents and higher child lead
              exposure vulnerability were associated with Potential Lead
              service lines in flexible spline models and linear models
              [RR=1.15 (95\% CrI: 1.11, 1.21) and RR=1.11 (95\% CrI: 1.02,
              1.20), respectively]. Associations were modified by borough;
              Potential Lead service lines were associated with higher
              proportions of non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Asian
              residents in the Bronx and Manhattan, and with higher proportions
              of non-Hispanic Black residents in Queens. DISCUSSION: NYC has a
              high number of Potential Lead and Unknown water service lines.
              Communities with a high proportion of Hispanic/Latino residents
              and those with children who are already highly vulnerable to lead
              exposures from numerous sources are disproportionately impacted
              by Potential Lead service lines. These findings can inform
              equitable service line replacement across New York state and NYC.

              socioeconomic vulnerability and CWS arsenic concentrations across
              the US. We evaluated previously developed, population-weighted
              CWS arsenic concentrations (2006--2011) and three socioeconomic
              domains (the proportion of adults with a high school diploma,

              evaluated the adjusted geometric mean ratio (GMR) of CWS arsenic
              concentrations per higher socioeconomic domain score
              corresponding to the interquartile range, and also evaluated
              flexible quadratic spline models. We also stratified by region
              and by United States Department of Agriculture Rural-Urban
              Continuum Codes to assess potential effect measure modification
              by region and rurality. Associations between socioeconomic
              vulnerability and CWS arsenic were modified by region and
              rurality and specific to socioeconomic domain. The fully adjusted
              GMR (95\% CIs) of CWS arsenic per interquartile range higher
              proportion of adults with a high school education was 0.83 (0.71,
              0.98) in the Southwest (corresponding to 17\% lower arsenic with
              higher education), 0.82 (0.71, 0.94) in the Eastern Midwest (18\%
              lower), and 0.65 (0.31, 1.36) in New England (35\% lower).
              Associations between median household income and CWS arsenic were
              largely null. Higher overall socioeconomic vulnerability was
              significantly associated with lower CWS arsenic, but only in
              counties in the Central Midwest and those with total populations
              less than 20,000. Findings may reflect regional/local differences
              in both socioeconomic/socio-cultural context and public drinking
              water regulatory efforts. Across the US, individual domains of

              phenotypes in the offspring. Between February 2015 and October
              2017, the S-PRESTO study recruited 1039 Chinese, Malay or Indian
              (or any combinations thereof) women aged 18-45 years and who
              intended to get pregnant and deliver in Singapore, resulting in
              1032 unique participants and 373 children born in the cohort. The
              participants were followed up for 3 visits during the
              preconception phase and censored at 12 months of follow up if
              pregnancy was not achieved (N = 557 censored). Women who
              successfully conceived (N = 475) were characterised at
              gestational weeks 6-8, 11-13, 18-21, 24-26, 27-28 and 34-36.
              Follow up of their index offspring (N = 373 singletons) is
              on-going at birth, 1, 3 and 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36
              months and beyond. Women are also being followed up
              post-delivery. Data is collected via interviewer-administered
              questionnaires, metabolic imaging (magnetic resonance imaging),
              standardized anthropometric measurements and collection of
              diverse specimens, i.e. blood, urine, buccal smear, stool, skin
              tapes, epithelial swabs at numerous timepoints. S-PRESTO has

               active air samplers (HV-AAS) and low volume active air samplers
               (LV-AAS). Samples were analyzed for perfluoroalkyl carboxylic

               fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs), fluorotelomer methacrylates

               suitability of different isotopically labeled fluorinated
               depuration compounds (DCs) revealed that 13C8-perfluorooctanoic
               acid (PFOA) was suitable for the calculation of site-specific

              emissions and relevant physicochemical properties. The new model,

  abstract = "During thermal processes utilized in affixing fluoropolymer
              coatings dispersion to fibers and fabrics, coating components are
              vaporized. It is suspected that per- and polyfluoroalkyl
              substances (PFAS) from the dispersions may undergo chemical
              transformations at the temperatures used, leading to additional
              emitted PFAS thermal byproducts. It is important to characterize
              these emissions to support evaluation of the resulting
              environmental and health impacts. In this study, a bench-scale
              system was built to simulate this industrial process via thermal
              application of dispersions to fiberglass utilizing relevant
              temperatures and residence times in sequential drying, baking,
              and sintering steps. Experiments were performed with two
              commercially available dispersions and a simple model mixture
              containing a single PFAS (6:2 fluorotelomer alcohol [6:2 FTOH]).
              Vapor-phase emissions were sampled and characterized by several
              off-line and real-time mass spectrometry techniques for targeted
              and nontargeted PFAS. Results indicate that multiple PFAS thermal
              transformation products and multiple nonhalogenated organic
              species were emitted from the exit of the high temperature third
              (sintering) furnace when 6:2 FTOH was the only PFAS present in
              the aqueous mixture. This finding supports the hypothesis that
              temperatures typical of these industrial furnaces may also induce
              chemical transformations within the fluorinated air emissions.
              Experiments using the two commercial fluoropolymer dispersions
              indicate air emissions of part-per-million by volume (ppmv)
              concentrations of heptafluoropropyl-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl
              ether (Fluoroether E1), as well as other PFAS at operationally
              relevant temperatures. We suspect that E1 is a direct thermal
              decomposition product (via decarboxylation) of
              2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoropropoxy)propanoic acid
              (commonly referred to as HFPO-DA) present in the dispersions.
              Other thermal decomposition products, including the monomer,
              tetrafluoroethene, may originate from the PFAS used to stabilize
              the dispersion or from the polymer particles in suspension. This
              study represents the first researcher-built coating application
              simulator to report nontargeted PFAS emission characterization,
              real-time analyses, and the quantification of 30 volatile target
              PFAS.Implications: Thermal processes used to affix fluoropolymers
              to fabrics are believed to be a source of PFAS air emissions.
              These coating operations are used by many large and small
              manufacturers and typically do not currently require any air
              emissions control. This research designed and constructed a
              bench-scale system that simulates these processes and used
              several off-line and advanced real-time mass spectroscopy
              techniques to characterize PFAS air emissions from two commercial
              fluoropolymer dispersions. Further, as the compositions of
              commercial dispersions are largely unknown, a model
              three-component solution containing a single PFAS was used to
              characterize emissions of multiple PFAS thermal transformation
              products at operationally relevant conditions. This research
              shows that fluoropolymer fabric coating facilities can be sources
              of complex mixtures of PFAS air emissions that include volatile
              and semivolatile PFAS present in the dispersions, as well as PFAS
              byproducts formed by the thermal transformation of fluorocarbon
              and hydrocarbon species present in these dispersions.",

              PFASs were the perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane
              sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), and
              fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs). All of these chemicals exhibited

               firefighting foams, and industrial applications. They have been
               detected all over the globe, including at remote locations
               distant from any possible point sources. One mechanism for
               long-range transport of PFAS is through sorption to aerosol
               particles in the atmosphere. PFAS can be transferred from the
               sea surface to sea spray aerosol particles through wave breaking
               and bubble bursting, and PFAS emitted to the atmosphere in the
               gas phase can sorb to particulate matter through gas-particle
               partitioning. Here we present a comprehensive review of global
               measurements of PFAS on ambient particulate matter dating back
               to the first reports from the early 2000s. We summarize findings

              particles PM2.5 (particulate matter that has a diameter $\leq$2.5

              restricted by Stockholm convention perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA),
              and 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTS) were detected at

              PFASs on the filters but may be lower than those generally

              with a polyurethane foam (PUF)-XAD-2-PUF sandwich (gaseous
              phase). Typical outdoor air volumes required for the
              determination of per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS)
              ranged from 500-1800 m3. GFFs and PUF-XAD columns were analysed
              separately to obtain information on phase partitioning. All air
              samples were analysed for volatile, neutral PFAS, with selected
              GFF samples halved for analysis of both neutral and airborne
              particle-bound ionic PFAS. Volatile PFAS were extracted from air
              samples by cold-column immersion with ethyl acetate, and were
              analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the positive
              chemical ionisation mode (GC-PCI-MS). Ionic PFAS were extracted
              from GFFs by sonication in methanol, and were analysed by liquid
              chromatography-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS) using
              electrospray ionisation in the negative ion mode (ESI-).
              Perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) was often the predominant analyte found
              in the particulate phase at concentrations ranging from 1-818 pg
              m(-3), and 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH) and 6:2 FTOH were the
              prevailing analytes found in the gas phase, at 5-243 pg m(-3) and
              5-189 pg m(-3), respectively. These three PFAS were ubiquitous in
              air samples. Many other PFAS, both neutral and ionic, were also
              present, and levels of individual analytes were in the 1-125 pg
              m(-3) range. Levels of some PFAS exceeded those of traditional
              persistent organic pollutants (POPs). In this study, the presence
              of 12:2 FTOH and fluorotelomer olefins (FTolefins), and ionic
              PFAS other than perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and PFOA, are
              reported in air samples for the first time. Concentrations of
              neutral PFAS were several orders of magnitude higher in indoor
              air than outdoor air, making homes a likely important diffuse
              source of PFAS to the atmosphere. Our repeated findings of
              non-volatile ionic PFAS in air samples raises the possibility
              that they might directly undergo significant atmospheric
              transport on particles away from source regions, and more
              atmospheric measurements of ionic PFAS are strongly recommended.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Disruption of thyroid homeostasis has been indicated
              in human studies targeting effects of persistent organic
              pollutants (POPs). Influence on the maternal thyroid system by
              POPs is of special interest during pregnancy because such effects
              could impair infant thyroid homeostasis. OBJECTIVES: We
              investigated the association between POPs and thyroid-stimulating
              hormone (TSH) and thyroid hormones (THs) in mother and child
              pairs from the Northern Norway Mother-and-Child Contaminant
              Cohort Study (MISA). METHODS: Nineteen POPs and 10 thyroid
              parameters were analyzed in serum from 391 pregnant women in
              their second trimester. In addition, TSH concentrations in
              heel-prick samples from the infants were analyzed by the
              Norwegian Newborn Screening program. Association studies with a
              multipollutant approach were performed using multivariate
              analyses; partial least squares (PLS) regression, hierarchical
              clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA). RESULTS:
              Several POPs were significantly associated with TSH and THs: a)
              PFOS was positively associated with TSH; b) PCBs, HCB, and
              nonachlors were inversely associated with T3, T4, and FT4; and,
              c) PFDA and PFUnDA were inversely associated with T3 and FT3.
              After mutual adjustments for the other contaminants, only PFDA
              and PFUnDA remained significantly associated with T3 and FT3,
              respectively. Infants born to mothers within the highest TSH
              quartile had 10\% higher mean concentrations of TSH compared with
              children born to mothers in the lowest TSH quartile. CONCLUSION:
              The present results suggest that background exposures to POPs can
              alter maternal thyroid homeostasis. This research contributes to
              the understanding of multipollutant exposures using multivariate
              statistical approaches and highlights the complexity of
              investigating environmental concentrations and mixtures in regard
              to maternal and infant thyroid function. Citation: Berg V,

              epidemiological evidence linking prenatal PFAS exposure to child
              neurodevelopment is equivocal and scarce. OBJECTIVE: To quantify
              associations between prenatal exposure to legacy PFAS and
              children's intelligence (IQ) and executive functioning (EF) in a
              Canadian pregnancy and birth cohort and to determine if these
              associations differ by child sex. METHODS: We measured
              first-trimester plasma concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid
              (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), and
              perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) in the Maternal-Infant
              Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) study and assessed
              children's full-scale (n = 522), performance (n = 517), and
              verbal (n = 519) IQ using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary
              Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-III). Children's working memory (n =
              513) and ability to plan and organize (n = 514) were assessed
              using a parent-reported questionnaire, the Behavior Rating
              Inventory of Executive Function - Preschool Version (BRIEF-P). We
              quantified associations between individual log2-transformed PFAS
              exposure and children's IQ and EF using multiple linear
              regression analyses and evaluated effect modification by child
              sex. We also used Repeated Holdout Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS)
              regression models with effect modification by child sex to
              quantify the effect of combined exposure to all three PFAS
              chemicals on IQ and EF. All models were adjusted for key
              sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Geometric mean plasma
              concentrations (IQR) for PFOA, PFOS and PFHxS were 1.68
              (1.10-2.50), 4.97 (3.20-6.20) and 1.09 (0.67-1.60) $\mu$g/L
              respectively. We found evidence of effect modification by child
              sex in all models examining performance IQ (p < .01).
              Specifically, every doubling of PFOA, PFOS, and or PFHxS was
              inversely associated with performance IQ, but only in males
              (PFOA: B = -2.80, 95\% CI: -4.92, -0.68; PFOS: B = -2.64, 95\%
              CI: -4.77, -0.52; PFHxS: B = -2.92, 95\% CI: -4.72, -1.12).
              Similarly, every quartile increase in the WQS index was
              associated with poorer performance IQ in males (B = -3.16, 95\%
              CI: -4.90, -1.43), with PFHxS contributing the largest weight to
              the index. In contrast, no significant association was found for
              females (B = 0.63, 95\% CI: -0.99, 2.26). No significant
              associations were found for EF in either males or females.
              CONCLUSIONS: Higher prenatal PFAS exposure was associated with
              lower performance IQ in males, suggesting that this association

              substances (PFAS) have been linked to adverse birth outcomes.
              Previous research showed that higher folate concentrations are
              associated with lower blood PFAS concentrations in adolescents
              and adults. Further studies are needed to explore whether
              prenatal folate status mitigates PFAS-related adverse birth
              outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether prenatal folate status
              modifies the negative associations between pregnancy PFAS
              concentrations, birth weight, and gestational age previously
              observed in a US cohort. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a
              prospective design, a prebirth cohort of mothers or pregnant
              women was recruited between April 1999 and November 2002, in
              Project Viva, a study conducted in eastern Massachusetts.
              Statistical analyses were performed from May 24 and October 25,
              2022. EXPOSURE: Plasma concentrations of 6 PFAS compounds were
              measured in early pregnancy (median gestational week, 9.6).
              Folate status was assessed through a food frequency questionnaire
              and measured in plasma samples collected in early pregnancy. MAIN
              OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Birth weight and gestational age,
              abstracted from delivery records; birth weight z score,
              standardized by gestational age and infant sex; low birth weight,
              defined as birth weight less than 2500 g; and preterm birth,
              defined as birth at less than 37 completed gestational weeks.
              RESULTS: The cohort included a total of 1400 mother-singleton
              pairs. The mean (SD) age of the mothers was 32.21 (4.89) years.
              Most of the mothers were White (73.2\%) and had a college degree
              or higher (69.1\%). Early pregnancy plasma perfluorooctanoic acid
              concentration was associated with lower birth weight and birth
              weight z score only among mothers whose dietary folate intake
              (birth weight: $\beta$, -89.13 g; 95\% CI, -166.84 to -11.42 g;
              birth weight z score: -0.13; 95\% CI, -0.26 to -0.003) or plasma
              folate concentration (birth weight: -87.03 g; 95\% CI, -180.11 to
              6.05 g; birth weight z score: -0.14; 95\% CI, -0.30 to 0.02) were
              below the 25th percentile (dietary: 660 $\mu$g/d, plasma: 14
              ng/mL). No associations were found among mothers in the higher
              folate level groups, although the tests for heterogeneity did not
              reject the null. Associations between plasma perfluorooctane
              sulfonic acid and perfluorononanoate (PFNA) concentrations and
              lower birth weight, and between PFNA and earlier gestational age
              were noted only among mothers whose prenatal dietary folate
              intake or plasma folate concentration was in the lowest quartile
              range. No associations were found among mothers in higher folate
              status quartile groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this large,
              US prebirth cohort, early pregnancy exposure to select PFAS
              compounds was associated with adverse birth outcomes only among
              mothers below the 25th percentile of prenatal dietary or plasma
              folate levels.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of
              contaminants used in many industrial applications and consumer
              products. Certain PFAS are regulated or voluntarily limited due
              to concern about environmental persistence and adverse health
              effects. OBJECTIVES: In this analysis we examine PFAS levels and
              their association with metabolic syndrome and its components,
              using a representative sample of the U.S. METHODS: Data on PFAS
              levels and metabolic syndrome components were collected from the
              2007-2008, 2009-2010, 2011-2012, and 2013-2014 cycles of the
              National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Twelve
              different PFAS were measured in serum samples from participants.
              Logistic regression models were used to identify associations
              between metabolic syndrome, its individual components, and serum
              PFAS concentrations. RESULTS: Over one-third (37\%) of
              participants met the definition for metabolic syndrome, with
              increased waist circumference and elevated glucose being the most
              commonly reported components. Seven PFAS were detected in at
              least 30\% of participants and were examined in subsequent
              analyses (PFDA, PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, MPAH, PFNA, PFUnDA). The PFAS
              with the highest concentrations was PFOS (median 8.4 ng/mL),
              followed by PFOA, PFHxS and PFNA. After adjusting for potential
              confounders, PFNA was associated with increased risk of metabolic
              syndrome and well as several individual components, while the
              highest levels of PFHxS were associated with elevated
              triglycerides. Other PFAS were associated with decreased risk of
              at least one outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Associations between PFAS and
              metabolic syndrome are inconsistent within and across studies.
              PFNA was consistently associated with increased risk for
              components of the syndrome, a finding that warrants further

              and in humans are lower than those of perfluorooctane sulfonate
              (PFOS) or perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a steady trend of
              increases in the general population in recent years has drawn
              considerable interest and concern. Previous studies with PFOS and
              PFOA have indicated developmental toxicity in laboratory rodent
              models. The current study extends the evaluation of these adverse
              outcomes to PFNA in mice. PFNA was given to timed-pregnant CD-1
              mice by oral gavage daily on gestational day 1-17 at 1, 3, 5 or
              10mg/kg; controls received water vehicle. Dams given 10mg/kg PFNA
              could not carry their pregnancy successfully and effects of this
              dose group were not followed. Similar to PFOS and PFOA, PFNA at
              5mg/kg or lower doses produced hepatomegaly in the pregnant dams,
              but did not affect the number of implantations, fetal viability,
              or fetal weight. Mouse pups were born alive and postnatal
              survival in the 1 and 3mg/kg PFNA groups was not different from
              that in controls. In contrast, although most of the pups were
              also born alive in the 5mg/kg PFNA group, 80\% of these neonates
              died in the first 10 days of life. The pattern of PFNA-induced
              neonatal death differed somewhat from those elicited by PFOS or
              PFOA. A majority of the PFNA-exposed pups survived a few days
              longer after birth than those exposed to PFOS or PFOA, which

              Surviving neonates exposed to PFNA exhibited dose-dependent

              increased liver weight seen in PFNA-exposed offspring persisted
              into adulthood and was likely related to the persistence of the

              proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR$\alpha$) target genes
              by PFNA that resembled the responses of PFOA. Our results

              comparable to that of PFOS and PFOA, and that these adverse

              wild-type (WT) mice to investigate the role of PPAR$\alpha$ in
              mediating PFNA-induced in vivo effects. Pregnant KO and WT mice
              were dosed orally with water (vehicle control: 10 ml/kg), 0.83,
              1.1, 1.5, or 2 mg/kg PFNA on gestational days (GDs) 1-18 (day of
              sperm plug = GD 0). Maternal weight gain, implantation, litter
              size, and pup weight at birth were unaffected in either strain.
              PFNA exposure reduced the number of live pups at birth and
              survival of offspring to weaning in the 1.1 and 2 mg/kg groups in
              WT. Eye opening was delayed (mean delay 2.1 days) and pup weight

              endpoints were not affected in the KO. Relative liver weight was

              Eight PFASs were analyzed in maternal serum (median: 10 weeks of
              pregnancy). Associations between prenatal PFAS exposure and birth
              outcomes with BW, BW for gestational age, and birth small for
              gestational age (SGA) were assessed in 1533 infants, adjusted for

              Prenatal PFAS exposure has been associated with lower birth
              weight; however, impacts on body composition and factors
              responsible for this association are unknown. OBJECTIVES: We
              aimed to estimate associations between maternal PFAS
              concentrations and offspring weight and adiposity at birth, and
              secondarily to estimate associations between PFAS concentrations
              and maternal glucose and lipids, and to evaluate the potential
              for these nutrients to mediate associations between PFAS and
              neonatal outcomes. METHODS: Within the Healthy Start prospective
              cohort, concentrations of 11 PFAS, fasting glucose, and lipids
              were measured in maternal mid-pregnancy serum (n=628). Infant
              body composition was measured using air displacement
              plethysmography. Associations between PFAS and birth weight and
              adiposity, and between PFAS and maternal glucose and lipids, were
              estimated via linear regression. Associations were decomposed
              into direct and indirect effects. RESULTS: Five PFAS were
              detectable in >50\% of participants. Maternal perfluorooctanoate
              (PFOA) and perfluorononanoate (PFNA) concentrations were
              inversely associated with birth weight. Adiposity at birth was
              approximately 10\% lower in the highest categories of PFOA, PFNA,
              and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) compared to the lowest
              categories. PFOA, PFNA, perfluorodecanoate (PFDeA), and PFHxS
              were inversely associated with maternal glucose. Up to 11.6\% of
              the effect of PFAS on neonatal adiposity was mediated by maternal
              glucose concentrations. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was not
              significantly associated with any outcomes studied. CONCLUSIONS:
              Follow-up of offspring will determine the potential long-term

              with prenatal PFAS exposure. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP641.",

              identified that looked at the association between human PFOS

              associated with risk for preeclampsia, the leading cause of

              This study investigated relevant maternal and fetal health
              outcomes after gestational exposure to PFBS in a New Zealand
              White rabbit model. Nulliparous female rabbits were supplied
              drinking water containing 0 mg/l (control), 10 mg/l (low), or 100
              mg/l (high) PFBS. Maternal blood pressure, body weights, liver
              and kidney weights histopathology, clinical chemistry panels, and
              thyroid hormone levels were evaluated. Fetal endpoints evaluated
              at necropsy included viability, body weights, crown-rump length,
              and liver and kidney histopathology, whereas placenta endpoints
              included weight, morphology, histopathology, and full
              transcriptome RNA sequencing. PFBS-high dose dams exhibited
              significant changes in blood pressure markers, seen through
              increased pulse pressure and renal resistive index measures, as
              well as kidney histopathological changes. Fetuses from these dams
              showed decreased crown-rump length. Statistical analysis of
              placental weight via a mixed model statistical approach
              identified a significant interaction term between PFBS high dose
              and fetal sex, suggesting a sex-specific effect on placental

              maternal outcomes, such as renal injury and hypertension, and
              fetal outcomes, including decreased growth parameters and adverse
              placenta function. These outcomes raise concerns about pregnant

              pollutants. Experimental data suggest that they may be associated
              with adverse health outcomes, including asthma. However, there is
              little supporting epidemiological evidence. METHODS: A total of
              231 asthmatic children and 225 nonasthmatic controls, all from
              northern Taiwan, were recruited in the Genetic and Biomarkers
              study for Childhood Asthma. Structure questionnaires were
              administered by face-to-face interview. Serum concentrations of
              11 PFCs and levels of immunological markers were also measured.
              Associations of PFC quartiles with concentrations of
              immunological markers and asthma outcomes were estimated using
              multivariable regression models. RESULTS: Nine PFCs were
              detectable in most children ($\geq$ 84.4\%), of which
              perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the most abundant (median
              serum concentrations of 33.9 ng/mL in asthmatics and 28.9 ng/mL
              in controls). Adjusted odds ratios for asthma among those with
              the highest versus lowest quartile of PFC exposure ranged from
              1.81 (95\% CI: 1.02, 3.23) for the perfluorododecanoic acid
              (PFDoA) to 4.05 (95\% CI: 2.21, 7.42) for perfluorooctanic acid
              (PFOA). PFOS, PFOA, and subsets of the other PFCs were positively
              associated with serum IgE concentrations, absolute eosinophil
              counts (AEC), eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) concentrations,
              and asthma severity scores among asthmatics. CONCLUSIONS: This
              study suggests an association between PFC exposure and juvenile
              asthma. Because of widespread exposure to these chemicals, these
              findings may be of potential public health concern.",

              increased serum PFAAs levels may promote TH cell dysregulation
              and alter the availability of key TH1 and TH2 cytokines,
              ultimately contributing to the development of asthma that may
              differentially impact males to a greater degree than females.

              properties that have become ubiquitous in our environment because
              of their widespread use. PFAS exposure has been associated with
              adverse health effects, and it is therefore vital to know how
              exposure may occur. Many studies have focused on environmental
              exposure from drinking water, but there is a paucity of data on
              inhalation exposure, especially in occupational settings.
              METHODS: In this study, through a comprehensive literature
              search, measured airborne (i.e., aerosols, volatiles, and dust)
              inhalation exposure and area levels were compiled for various
              occupations to compare reported levels of PFAS exposure. Airborne
              PFAS levels measured in various occupations such as ski waxing,
              textile manufacturing, firefighting, and floor waxing were
              analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Results of this review
              demonstrate that workers experience varying levels of PFAS
              exposure contingent on the workplace and industry and the work
              tasks performed within the workplace. Out of all occupations, ski
              waxing exhibited the highest total PFAS airborne concentrations
              when compared to all other reported occupational and residential
              exposures. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is recommended to
              estimate the risk of PFAS exposures in the occupations reviewed
              and to identify other potential occupations at risk of PFAS
              exposure. In addition, informed recommendations to implement

  abstract = "Noncausal associations between exposures and outcomes are a
              threat to validity of causal inference in observational studies.
              Many techniques have been developed for study design and analysis
              to identify and eliminate such errors. Such problems are not
              expected to compromise experimental studies, where careful
              standardization of conditions (for laboratory work) and
              randomization (for population studies) should, if applied
              properly, eliminate most such noncausal associations. We argue,
              however, that a routine precaution taken in the design of
              biologic laboratory experiments--the use of ``negative
              controls''--is designed to detect both suspected and unsuspected
              sources of spurious causal inference. In epidemiology, analogous
              negative controls help to identify and resolve confounding as
              well as other sources of error, including recall bias or analytic
              flaws. We distinguish 2 types of negative controls (exposure
              controls and outcome controls), describe examples of each type
              from the epidemiologic literature, and identify the conditions
              for the use of such negative controls to detect confounding. We
              conclude that negative controls should be more commonly employed
              in observational studies, and that additional work is needed to
              specify the conditions under which negative controls will be
              sensitive detectors of other sources of error in observational
              studies.",

              per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) using an annular
              diffusion denuder sampler. Samples were analyzed for 7 PFAS

              fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs), fluorotelomer methacrylates

              sulfonamides (FOSAs), and perfluorooctane sulfonamidoethanols
              (FOSEs)]. The measured particulate associated fraction ($\Phi$')
              using the diffusion denuder sampler generally followed the trend
              FTACs (0\%) < FTOHs (~8\%) < FOSAs (~21\%) < PFSAs (~29\%) <

              The ionizability of some PFASs, when associated with particles,
              is an important consideration when calculating the gas-particle
              partitioning coefficient as both ionic and neutral forms can be
              present in the particles. Here we differentiate between a
              gas-particle partitioning coefficient for neutral species, K(p),
              and one that accounts for both ionic and neutral species of a
              compound, K(p)'. The measured K(p)' for PFSAs and PFCAs was 4-5
              log units higher compared to the interpolated K(p) for the
              neutral form only. The measured K(p)' can be corrected (to apply
              to the neutral form only) with knowledge of the pK(a) of the
              chemical and the pH of the condensed medium (``wet'' particle or
              aqueous aerosol). The denuder-based sampling of PFASs has yielded
              a robust data set that demonstrates the importance of atmospheric

              stress, as operationalized by Allostatic Load (AL), among adults
              aged $\geq$20 years. Methods: To explore the interactions of
              occupation with PFAS levels and AL, data from the National Health
              and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007−2014 were used. We
              performed Poisson regression modeling to evaluate AL's
              relationships with PFAS concentrations and occupations on
              weighted data. Results: The results demonstrated that increased
              AL was positively associated with different occupation groups
              such as a) Public Administration and b) Arts, Entertainment, and
              Recreation (p-values 0.018 and 0.002, respectively), and with
              certain PFAS concentrations (Perfluorooctanoic acid, PFOA,
              p-value = 0.002). Finally, AL had a strong association with the
              interaction of some PFAS such as Perfluorobutane sulfonic acid
              (PFBS) and occupation (AL: PFBS: occupation, p-value < 0.0001),

              the work environment to promote longevity among the workforce in

              homeostasis during pregnancy is limited and the results were

              PFAS exposure and glucose homeostasis in pregnancy in a large
              prospective cohort. METHODS: A total of 2747 pregnant women who
              participated in the Shanghai Birth Cohort, had blood samples in
              early pregnancy and completed a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test
              (OGTT) at 24-28 gestational weeks were included. 10 PFAS were
              determined by high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass
              spectrometry (HPLC/MS-MS) in the plasma samples in early
              pregnancy. Logistic regression was used to explore the
              associations between PFAS concentrations and gestational diabetes
              mellitus (GDM), while multiple linear regression was used to
              model the associations between PFAS and OGTT fasting, 1-h and 2-h
              glucose levels. Potential confounders were adjusted. Bayesian
              kernel machine regression (BKMR) and a quantile-based

              joint and independent effects of PFAS on glucose homeostasis.

              perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) and PFHpA were positively
              correlated with 1-h and 2-h glucose levels. Results of the mixed

              significantly associated with abnormal glucose homeostasis; In
              the BKMR model, PFAS mixture exposure was positively associated
              with the GDM incidence, 1-h and 2-h glucose levels and negatively
              correlated with FBG level. A similar trend could be observed in
              qgcomp and the positive correlation between PFAS and 2-h glucose
              level was significant ($\beta$ = 0.12, 95\% CI: 0.04, 0.20).
              PFOS, PFNA and PFHpA may be the main contributors after
              controlling for other PFAS congeners. PFOS was significantly
              correlated with GDM incidence and 2-h glucose level, and PFHpA
              was significantly associated with FBG and 2-h glucose levels. The
              above associations were more prominent among women with a normal
              prepregnant BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental exposure to PFAS may
              affect glucose homeostasis in pregnancy and increase the risk of
              GDM, especially in normal weight women.",

               polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have greatly increased in the

               assess the state of the science regarding toxicological effects
               of PFAS and to develop strategies for advancing knowledge on the
               health effects of this large family of chemicals. Currently,
               much of the toxicity data available for PFAS are for a handful
               of chemicals, primarily legacy PFAS such as perfluorooctanoic
               acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate. Epidemiological studies have
               revealed associations between exposure to specific PFAS and a
               variety of health effects, including altered immune and thyroid
               function, liver disease, lipid and insulin dysregulation, kidney
               disease, adverse reproductive and developmental outcomes, and
               cancer. Concordance with experimental animal data exists for
               many of these effects. However, information on modes of action
               and adverse outcome pathways must be expanded, and profound
               differences in PFAS toxicokinetic properties must be considered
               in understanding differences in responses between the sexes and
               among species and life stages. With many health effects noted
               for a relatively few example compounds and hundreds of other
               PFAS in commerce lacking toxicity data, more contemporary and
               high-throughput approaches such as read-across, molecular
               dynamics, and protein modeling are proposed to accelerate the
               development of toxicity information on emerging and legacy PFAS,
               individually and as mixtures. In addition, an appropriate degree
               of precaution, given what is already known from the PFAS

              disruption, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. PFAS have been
              produced in the U.S. since the 1940s and now encompass a growing
              chemical family comprised of diverse chemical moieties, yet the

              associated with adverse outcomes for both mother and offspring,
              such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), including
              preeclampsia, and low birth weight. Given the relationship

               meet the need for a robust method of systematic and transparent
               research synthesis in environmental health science. We conducted
               a case study systematic review to support proof of concept of
               the method. OBJECTIVE: We applied the Navigation Guide
               systematic review methodology to determine whether developmental
               exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) affects fetal growth
               in humans. METHODS: We applied the first 3 steps of the
               Navigation Guide methodology to human epidemiological data: 1)
               specify the study question, 2) select the evidence, and 3) rate
               the quality and strength of the evidence. We developed a
               protocol, conducted a comprehensive search of the literature,
               and identified relevant studies using prespecified criteria. We
               evaluated each study for risk of bias and conducted
               meta-analyses on a subset of studies. We rated quality and
               strength of the entire body of human evidence. RESULTS: We
               identified 18 human studies that met our inclusion criteria, and
               9 of these were combined through meta-analysis. Through
               meta-analysis, we estimated that a 1-ng/mL increase in serum or
               plasma PFOA was associated with a -18.9 g (95\% CI: -29.8, -7.9)
               difference in birth weight. We concluded that the risk of bias
               across studies was low, and we assigned a ``moderate'' quality
               rating to the overall body of human evidence. CONCLUSION: On the
               basis of this first application of the Navigation Guide
               systematic review methodology, we concluded that there is
               ``sufficient'' human evidence that developmental exposure to
               PFOA reduces fetal growth.",

              during the last years. As a result, the assessment of indoor dust
              quality is meaningful since dust can be a source of numerous
              emerging contaminants associated with adverse effects in human
              health. To this end, fourteen cars and ten trucks from the city
              of Thessaloniki, Northern Greece were selected to assess the
              quality of vehicles' microenvironments. An HRMS-based strategy
              was deployed for the target and non-target analysis of the
              collected samples. The target approach aimed at the accurate mass
              screening of nine organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) and
              nine per-/polyfluorinated compounds (PFAS), revealing mean
              concentrations for the OPFRs varied from <MQL--3409 ng/g for
              tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCP), while the PFASs
              were either not detected (<MDL) or detected below the
              quantification limit (<MQL). To exploit the advanced technology
              of HRMS, a non-target analysis (NTA) workflow was also designed
              and employed, allowing the identification of 17 non-targets

              analysis between the positive findings and vehicles' conditions
              evidenced a possible of association just for individual cases.

              analytes was applied with the view to assess the potential

              organic compounds, whose hydrogen atoms in the carbon chain
              substituted by fluorine atoms. PFASs exhibit developmental
              toxicity, carcinogenicity, hepatotoxicity, reproductive toxicity,
              immunotoxicity, and hormone toxicity. PFASs are used in the
              production of disposable food packages, aircraft and automobile
              devices, cooking utensils, outdoor gear, furniture and carpets,
              aqueous film forming foam (AFFF), cables and wires, electronics,
              and semiconductors. This study aimed to determine the association
              between crustacean consumption and serum PFASs. METHODS: Adult
              participants (2,993) aged $\geq$ 19 years were extracted from the
              4th cycle data of the Korean National Environmental Health Survey
              (KoNEHS). Based on the 50th percentile concentrations of serum
              PFASs, participants were divided into the low-concentration group
              (LC) and the high-concentration group (HC). General
              characteristics, dietary factors, coated product usage, and
              personal care product usage, an independent t-test and $\chi$2
              test were analyzed. The odds ratio (OR) of serum PFAS

              characteristics, dietary factors, coated product usage, and
              personal care product usage. RESULTS: The OR for the HC of serum
